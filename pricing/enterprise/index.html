			<h2>Dedicated account management</h2>

			<p>As an Enterprise customer, you will be assigned a dedicated account manager responsible for ensuring you are making the most out of your String3 subscription.  Through having a single point of contact, customisation of String3 to suit your product portfolio and risk profile can be achieved. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Unlimited questions</h2>
			<p>There is no limit to the amount of questions you can send on an Enterprise plan. Unlimited questions allows your organisation to have an extensive view of all your supply chains, target your audit activity and periodically check high risk supply chains are as responsive as you need them to be. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>Managed reporting</h2>
			<p>Unlimited questions allows you to create large data sets, providing broad insight into the dynamic nature of your extended supply networks. String3’s advanced reporting suite really comes into its own with these rich, diverse data. In addition, Enterprise subscribers benefit from our managed reporting service which includes custom questions as well as automated scheduling - to deliver the information you need, when you need it.</p>
		</li>
