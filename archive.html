			<p class="large">Global supply chains expose brands and retailers to risk. String3 enables you to pinpoint the areas of highest risk and focus your solutions. </p>

			<p class="subtle-links"><a href="/msa" title="Worried about Modern Day Slavery in your supply chains?">Modern slavery</a>, <a href="/deforestation" title="Worried about deforestation in your supply chains?">deforestation</a>, <a href="/conflict-minerals" title="Worried about conflict minerals in your supply chains?">conflict minerals</a>, animal welfare, human rights, chemical usage are just some of the risks you are exposed to as a result of the products you sell. Only by knowing where your products are actually being made can you take effective, preventive measures.</p>

			<p>String3 is a simple new alternative to manual supply chain data gathering processes. As you ask questions about your products, supply chains are connected together, stage by stage, whilst preserving commercial confidentiality. Information flows through the supply chain, giving you invaluable insight into where your products come from and where you are most exposed to risk.</p>

				<li class="featured-1">

					<h3>Get direct information beyond tier one</h3>
					<p class="small">String3 connects your supply chain together by asking a series of simple questions to your suppliers, who in turn ask questions of their suppliers, and so on. As your StringQuestions move along the chain, they are automatically reframed to be relevant at each production stage. You just send your StringQuestions to your immediate tier 1 supplier and the system does the rest.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="featured-2">
					<img src="/assets/img/over-time.png" alt="" />
					<h3>Map supply chains in real time</h3>
					<p class="small">String3 maps the supply chains of each of the products that you ask about. As each StringQuestion is passed on, your actual product supply chain is visualised in real time. The process can be repeated at any time to check for changes in the supply network.</p>
				</li>

				<li class="featured-3">
					<img src="/assets/img/data.png" alt="" />
					<h3>Receive easy and actionable reports</h3>
					<p class="small">String3 interprets your supply chain data into detailed reports that show exactly what is going on. You can cross reference this data with geographical risk information for the issues youâ€™re most worried about. That way, you can find out which products are posing the greatest risk to your brand.</p>
