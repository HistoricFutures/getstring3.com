		<p>Mapping your supply chain, by which we mean, knowing the origin of a product and understanding how raw materials are turned into finished goods, is no easy task. There can be thousands of global suppliers in product supply chains, and no single department within your company with responsibility for traceability. And yet, there are compelling reasons for companies to begin mapping their supply chains.</p>
	 
		<h2>Managing risk: Brand / business reputation</h2>

		<p>Many businesses have experienced substantial loss of value due to issues in their global supply chain, about which they had little or no knowledge. While Corporate Responsibility teams often understand what has the potential to adversely affect reputation, they generally do not have the tools to collect the information required to assess levels of risk, or to design mitigation strategies. </p>

		<p>String3 will address these needs, allowing you to ask your supply chain the questions you need answers to. </p>

		<h2>Managing risk: Regulatory compliance </h2>

		<p>Businesses face an increasing regulatory burden about their global supply chain. For example, the EU Timber Regulation and the US Dodd-Frank Act now require businesses to obtain information about the original source of raw materials, even though the supplier they are purchasing from may not know.</p>

		<p>String3 will address that need allowing you to ask your supply chain about the origins of the raw materials in your products. </p>

		<p>As consumers demand to know more about the origin of the raw materials in the items they buy, those companies that are unable to say, and verify their claims, will be left behind. </p>
