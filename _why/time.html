<div class="standard-intro">
<p>Without String3, the manual process of defining what it is you want to ask, gathering information and staying on top of the reporting can be long-winded and repetitive, String3 simplifies all that. We estimate that it could save your business over three and a half hours per question. If you ask 100 questions, thatâ€™s over 46 working days.</p>
