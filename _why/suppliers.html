		<h3>It saves suppliers time too</h3>
		<p>String3 makes it simple to respond to customers’ enquiries. It stores details of products and suppliers so that only new information has to be entered each time an enquiry is answered. The questions suppliers are asked are also broken down into a series of simple steps, which help to locate the suppliers at the right point in the supply chain and send your question on to the right place.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>It’s free for people responding to enquiries to use</h3>
		<p>There are no financial barriers for the people responding to your questions, only the person who intiated the question has to pay anything. This means that you are much more likely to get to the answers you need.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Everyone can be confident their sensitive information isn’t being shared with anyone else in their supply chain</h3>
		<p>Neither the person asking the question, nor anyone else in the supply chain, needs to know all the details of all the individual organisations involved in making the product, only the eventual answers. This means that suppliers can enter potentially commercially sensitive information into String3 that they wouldn’t necessarily be comfortable sharing over email.</p>
