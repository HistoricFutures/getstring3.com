		<h3>Question progress</h3>
		<p>With String3 you can follow the progress of your question up your supply chain, without suppliers having to disclose commercially sensitive information to you, with the Question Progress Report. Here you can see any problems that might be blocking the communication of your question to the full web of your suppliers.</p>
