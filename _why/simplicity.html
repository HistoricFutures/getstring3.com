<p class="large">String3 is a powerful new alternative to manual supply chain intelligence gathering processes.</p> 
<p>Defining what it is you want to ask, gathering information and staying on top of reporting can be long-winded, time consuming and repetitive. </p>
<p>String3 simplifies all that. String3 saves you time, consolidates your supply chain information within a single tool and allows for comparison of data over time. </p>
<p>
String3 is purposefully designed to remain simple, no complex or large amounts of data collection is needed.The key to getting reliable data about your products rests in having a connected supply network. With String3, suppliers can easily respond to simple questions knowing their identity and commercially sensitive information is never disclosed. </p>
