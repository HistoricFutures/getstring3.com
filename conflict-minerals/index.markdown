title:  Worried about conflict minerals in your supply chains?
strap: Use String3 to zoom in on the products that place your brand at the most risk. It's free.
issueIntro: Human rights abuses, child labour and environmental catastrophes can be linked to many of the products and product components that brands and retailers sell. Jewellery, building materials, our smartphones, tablets and laptops often contain mined metals, gemstones and other minerals. Demand for such consumables has increased globally and many of the natural resources needed for their production are found in areas where conflict and corruption are widespread.

  * Environmental degradation, child labour, modern slavery and health and safety issues for workers are commonplace within many of the places where mining and processing occurs. These are affecting an estimated 100 million people and their families worldwide.
  * In response, guidelines and laws seeking to identify risks and criminalise certain activities within precious metal supply chains have been developed.
  * As well as regulatory risk, reputational risk to companies operating within such supply chains is significant. The high value of especially precious metals and stones found in areas of economic deprivation makes it possible to earn essential finance quickly but leaves workers, their families and the environment open to potential abuse.

  Not knowing the origin of the metal, stone or other material you are using or where the processing took place to transform it into a finished product means companies don’t know what risks they are exposed to.

  It takes a lot of time and effort to manually gather the data needed to map supply chains, especially those which are more fragmented and lacking in transparency. As a result, brands are often left in the dark about the origin of their high value, often aspirational products or where processing activities took place.
solutionIntro: String3 connects the suppliers involved in making and moving your products without requiring anyone to disclose who they are. Questions can then be passed along the supply chain to get you the answers you need.
