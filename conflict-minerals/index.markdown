title:  Worried about conflict minerals in your supply chains?
strap: Use String3 to zoom in on the products that place your brand at the most risk.
issueIntro: Many consumers are concerned about the minerals contained within the things they buy. Some mineral mining can cause environmental damage, exploit child labour or abuse its workforce.

  If you are selling electronic devices, jewellery or building materials you may well be at risk.

  Regulations like the USAâ€™s Dodd Frank Act, as well as voluntary certification via bodies like the Responsible Jewellery Council requires you to know the original source of your materials.

  String3 can profile specific products and pinpoint risks.
solutionIntro: String3 connects the suppliers involved in making and moving your products whilst preserving commercial confidentiality. Questions can then be passed along the supply chain to get you the answers you need.
solutionBody: |
  Having information at your fingertips about where the metal, gemstones or other minerals in the products you sell originated, or where the processing stages took place puts you in control.

  String3 allows you to:

  * Track the provenance of products in real time

  * Identify likely sources of risk, for further investigation

  * Demonstrate effective scrutiny for compliance

  * Communicate publicly with confidence
