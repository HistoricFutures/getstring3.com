	<h2>Your information is never shared without your permission</h2>
	<p>We know that in the marketplace, sharing potentially commercially sensitive information is rarely something that you want to do. That’s why we make sure that even in the reports that people asking questions about their supply chains receive, everyone is anonymous by default. The organisations looking for answers get the information they need without having to know the details of every organisation in their supply chain.</p>
