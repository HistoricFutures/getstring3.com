	<h1>How does String3 work?</h1>
	<p class="large">String3 asks preprogrammed questions (StringQuestions) about product provenance and routes them to the organisations in your supply chain. </p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> Question Progress Reports</h2>
  <p class="large">Question progress reports give you detailed information about the supply chains for all the products that you ask about. All you need to do is send your questions and wait for answers to show.</p>
	<p>For each key production stage, valuable information about the suppliers involved is displayed, including how many different suppliers were involved, where they are located and how good they are at responding to questions.</p>

  <p class="large">The experts behind String3 research the materials and processes behind the products you sell. This means we’ve done a lot of the hard work for you, defining the main stages involved in transforming raw materials into finished products. Your StringQuestions will flow easily throughout the supply chain using one of these Process Maps.  </p>
  <p>We update our Process Maps all the time.  If you don’t see the material you need, simply email us and we’ll work with you to add it.

  <p class="large">Getting questions out of the door with String3 couldn’t be easier. Using our ready to use question templates, you simply add the details of the specific instance of supply of your products, details of your suppliers and emails are generated automatically.</p>
  <p>When you need to ask about many products or send questions to many suppliers we can help set up projects so that you don’t have to add in each product or supplier individually.</p>

	<p>If you would like to see how easy it is for yourself, request a live demo.</p>

  <div class="screencast-container">
    <img src="/assets/img/response.gif" alt="Supplier response" />
  </div>
  <p class="large">String3 works by asking a series of simple questions to your suppliers. All they have to do is answer whether they made or sourced each material in the process and pass it on to their suppliers, until you reach the organisations that can reliably answer your questions. </p><p>They can answer with confidence because their information is never shared with you but always kept confidential and anonymised. </p>
