	<h2><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> Question Progress Report</h2>
  <p class="large">Your question progress report gives you detailed information about your supply chain for any specific instance of supply of a product. All you need to do is send your question and it builds itself.</p> <p>For each key production stage, valuable information about the suppliers involved is displayed, including how many different suppliers were involved, where they are located and how good they are at responding to questions. </p>

  <p class="large">The experts behind String3 research the materials and processes behind the products retailers and brands sell. This means we’ve done a lot of the hard work for you, defining the main stages involved in transforming raw materials into finished products. Your questions can then flow easily throughout the supply chain using one of these processes. </p>
  <p>In addition, because questions sent using String3 are in a consistent format across your industry, suppliers will become accustomed to answering these questions quickly and easily. </p>
  <p>We’re updating our materials library all the time, so register for free to see the full list. If you don’t see the material you need, simply email us and we’ll work with you to add it.</p>

  <p class="large">String3 works by asking a series of simple questions to your suppliers. All they have to do is answer whether they made or sourced each material in the process and pass it on to their suppliers, until you reach the organisation that can reliably answer the question. </p><p>They can answer with confidence because their information is never shared with you but always kept confidential and anonymised. </p>
