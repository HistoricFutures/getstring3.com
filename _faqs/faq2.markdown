title:  "How can suppliers be confident the information they input is not shared with anyone?"

After more than 12 years of practical experience of collecting information from supply networks, we know how important it is that your sources of supply remain confidential. We have designed String3 with this requirement at its core. In String3, you will never see identifiable details of businesses you don’t already know, and neither will your customers or your suppliers (if you have them).

Connecting your supply network does not mean you will be able to see who everyone within it is. String3 works on the basis that you only see those organisations that you already do direct business with. Your direct suppliers can be certain that you, only see the their business name, not who they in turn source from. And likewise, supplier’s suppliers will not know who has responded to a question before it reached them.
