title:  "How much visibility about my supply chain will I get?"
order: 4

Despite not being able to see who every organisation is within your supply chain, over time, with more questions sent and more connections made, you will gain huge insight into how you supply chain operates. How many different organisations are involved in any one supply chain? Does this differ depending on what the product is? Which tiers are most responsive? Is my supplier good at passing questions on and chasing responses?
