order: 4

Despite not being able to see who every organisation is within your supply network, over time, with more questions sent and more connections made, you will gain significant insight into the size, location and responsiveness of your supply network. For example, how many different suppliers are involved in any given productâ€™s supply network? How many suppliers were involved at a certain production phase? Which of my suppliers are best at passing questions on and chasing responses?
