The question you send to your supplier is sent with a product identifier so your supplier knows the exact product you are asking about.  Your supplier responds as to whether they made or sourced it. If they sourced it or sourced the materials it was made from, they are asked who they sourced from and have to provide an identifier for the product or material in the same way you did. This continues throughout the supply chain. If a supplier anywhere in the network receives a request for information about a specific product or material they did not supply, there is no reason for them to confirm they supplied the organisation who sent them the question, nor will the question effectively propagate further. Only organisations who confirm that they are supplying the identified product or material will be connected, enabling your question to flow and reach the organisations who really know the answer.  String3 joins up existing customer-supplier connections, creating a network by which questions and answers can move.
