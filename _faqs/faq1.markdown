String3 uses existing customer-supplier connections to create a ‘network’ of the organisations that were involved in making the specific product you are asking about.
Your question is sent  to your supplier with information  that lets them know the exact product you are asking about (this information might be the purchase order number, or the delivery number - something both you and they will recognise).  They confirm whether they made or sourced it and provide new  product information for their supplier, in the same way you did. At each point where the question is passed on, the supplier receiving the question needs to validate whether they supplied the product/material to the person passing the question to them. If they don’t do this, the question is unable to keep moving through the network.

In this way, if any supplier selects an incorrect option, the question will stop moving. If they incorrectly select ‘made it’, but in fact they ‘sourced it’, this error will become clear when String3 asks them to provide details of the materials they used to make the product. If they select the wrong supplier to forward your question to, that supplier won’t recognise the request, as it will be asking about materials they didn’t supply. String3 provides you with tools to see how far through the network your question has progressed. A question that has stopped before reaching its answer might highlight potential issues.

Only organisations who confirm that they have supplied the identified product (or materials it was made from) will be connected, enabling your question to flow and reach the organisations who really know the answers.
