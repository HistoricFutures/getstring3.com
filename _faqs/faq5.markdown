You will receive reports showing the progress of your questions. The reports show how far your question has moved along the production phases of the product you are asking about. For example, a report about a viscose garment will show the phases within the supply network needed to make this viscose garment (finished garment; viscose fabric; viscose yarn; viscose pulp; timber) and how far along these production phases the question has currently reached. The report will highlight how good your direct supplier is at responding to your question by showing the date and time they responded and also how good their suppliers are at responding to them.
