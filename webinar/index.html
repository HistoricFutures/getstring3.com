                <p>Regulatory and reputational risks are rife within product supply chains. Deforestation, modern slavery, animal welfare, chemical usage… How do you know where to start? It's possible to say with certainty that modern slavery exists - but is it in your present in the supply chains that made your products? Deforestation unquestionably happens, but are your products part of the problem? Are you going to ask the 1000+ organisations involved, from raw material onwards to try and find out? Even if you knew who they were? Join our webinar to learn how to use String3 to take a risk based approach to managing the risks within your product supply chains. </p>

            <p>There are 2 major steps to creating a map 1) discovering the information required 2) taking the information and producing an image that helps communicate the new knowledge. Cartographers use their skills to create the documents that attempt to model the real world as closely as possible. In product supply chains we have a slightly different, but related, problem. What do we want our map to represent, and how accurate does it need to be? </p>
            <p>Join our webinar to learn how String3 maps your supply chains, helping you identify which products are placing your brand at the most risk. </p>
