title:  Worried about modern day slavery in your supply chains?
strap: Use String3 to zoom in on the products that place your brand at the most risk. It's free.
issueIntro: According to the Global Slavery Index, an estimated 30 million people in the world today live in some form of modern slavery. The increasingly complex nature of global supply chains means that most brands and retailers are exposed to modern slavery risks as a result of the products they sell.

  * Reputational risk is extremely high. As a brand or retailer, not knowing whether you are affected by modern slavery is no longer acceptable.
  * The Modern Slavery Act, enacted in March 2015, places a regulatory requirement on UK businesses to prepare a statement “…setting out the steps the organisation has taken during the financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking was not taking place in its business or supply chains…”.
  * Supply chain mapping is one recommended action step. However, this can be a huge challenge for many brands who have limited knowledge of, let alone access to the suppliers operating deep within their supply chains.

  It takes a lot of time and effort to manually gather the data needed to map supply chains. Passing the responsibility onto tier one suppliers adds uncertainty about reliability. To demonstrate that active enquiries into the supply chain have been made means brands and retailers need to take control of the data to map their supply chains.
solutionIntro: String3 collects country of process information from the suppliers involved in making and moving your product without anyone having to disclose who they are. As you use String3 to ask your suppliers questions, reports are generated giving you accurate information about the different countries in which your products were made.

  Asking questions about your most high risk products means you can quickly assess which are exposing you to the greatest risk and which you need to worry less about.  If you don’t know which products to start asking about, we can support you in developing a risk framework as part of our consultancy services.

  Because you can’t audit everyone all of the time, obtaining country of process information is a crucial step in your supply chain transparency journey. String3 gives you the opportunity to  demonstrate that you have taken active steps to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within your supply chains.
