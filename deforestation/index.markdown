title:  Worried about deforestation in your supply chains?
strap: Use String3 to zoom in on the products that place your brand at the most risk. It's free.
issueIntro: Deforestation and illegal logging can be linked to many of the products brands and retailers sell. Paper, furniture, latex, cellophane and clothing are all products that might contain tree fibres. Agricultural industries who clear forests for the production of soy, palm oil and other commodities we consume are also putting forests under strain.

  Environmental degradation, illegal logging, destruction of endangered forests and deforestation are all on the rise.

  * The EU timber regulation (EUTR) which came into force in the UK in 2013 means it is against the law to put illegally harvested or illegal timber products on the market.
  * As well as regulatory risk, reputational risk is also high in this area. Many fashion brands face pressure to ensure tree fibres for viscose production are not sourced from endangered forests or are the result of illegal harvesting.
  * Not knowing the origin of the fibre or where the processing took place to transform fibre into finished product means companies donâ€™t know what risks they are exposed to.

  Lack of supply chain transparency is rife at all stages of the supply chain with each tier only knowing who they themselves source from. As a result, brands are often left in the dark about the origin of the tree fibres or where processing activities took place.
solutionIntro: String3 connects the suppliers involved in making and moving your product without requiring anyone to disclose who they are. Questions can then be passed along the supply chain to get you the answers you need.

  Having information at your fingertips about where the fibres originated, or where the processing stages took place puts you in control.

  By using String3 you can identify which of your products present the most risk to your brand and monitor those risks over time. String3 also gives you the opportunity to communicate confidently about products you can demonstrate have been responsibly sourced.
